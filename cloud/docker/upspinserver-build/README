This directory contains the scripts for creating a Google Container Builder
build and trigger for building the gcr.io/upspin-containers/upspinserver image.
This image is used by servers deployed by upspin-ui.

How it works

1. Gerrit pushes a commit to the github.com/upspin/gcp repository.
2. Google's infrastructure automatically pulls that commit into a private Git
   repo inside the upspin-prod Google Cloud Project.
3. Step 2 triggers a Google Container Builder build, which launches a Docker
   image to build the release.
4. The build steps:
   a. Build the upspinserver-gcp binary.
   b. Build a Docker image and push it to gcr.io/upspin-containers/upspinserver.

Setting it up

This document assumes you have permissions to work with the 'upspin-prod'
and 'upspin-containers' Google Cloud projects.

First, log in with gcloud:
	$ gcloud auth login

Create a Source Repository named 'gcp' and configure it to mirror
the contents of the github.com/upspin/gcp repo.
	https://cloud.google.com/code/develop/repo

Create the 'upspinserver' build step using upspin-deploy-gcp:
	$ go get gcp.upspin.io/cmd/upspin-deploy-gcp
	$ upspin-deploy-gcp -upspinserver-image

Create a trigger that runs the relevant build steps
on each new commit to the 'gcp':
	$ ./createtriggers.sh -prod
(Without -prod it creates the trigger in the upspin-test repo.)

In the 'upspin-containers' project, adjust the permissions of the Storage
bucket named
	artifacts.upspin-containers.appspot.com
giving the service account
	901285477962@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com
the 'Cloud Container Builder' role. (The number in the service account
name is the numeric Project ID of 'upspin-prod'.)

To test that everything is working, trigger the builds manually:
	https://cloud.google.com/gcr/triggers
Once complete, a fresh image should be available at
	gcr.io/upspin-containers/upspinserver
If the build fails, look at the log output of the build for clues:
	https://cloud.google.com/gcr/builds
