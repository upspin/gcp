This directory contains the scripts for creating a Google Container Builder
build step and trigger for rolling Upspin binary releases.

How it works

1. Gerrit pushes a commit to the github.com/upspin/upspin repository.
2. Google's infrastructure automatically pulls that commit into a private Git
   repo inside the upspin-prod Google Cloud Project.
3. Step 2 triggers a Google Container Builder build, which launches a Docker
   image to build the release.
4. The Docker image:
   a. Fetches dependencies,
   b. Builds the upspin, upspinfs, and cacheserver binaries,
   c. Writes the resulting binaries to the release@upspin.io Upspin tree,
   d. Updates the links inside release@upspin.io/latest.

How it works for non-core repositories (augie.upspin.io, for example)

The same as the above, but step 4d is not performed.

Setting it up

This document assumes you have permissions to work with the 'upspin-prod'
Google Cloud project.

First, log in with gcloud:
	$ gcloud auth login

Create a Source Repository named 'upspin' and configure it to mirror
the contents of the github.com/upspin/upspin repo.
	https://cloud.google.com/code/develop/repo
Do the same for 'augie'.

Generate the keys for release@upspin.io from the secret seed and put them in
the 'gcp.upspin.io/cloud/docker/release/secrets' directory (talk to your fellow
Upspin team member for the secret):
	$ mkdir secrets
	$ upspin keygen -where=./secrets -secretseed $SEED

Create the 'release' build step using upspin-deploy-gcp:
	$ go get gcp.upspin.io/cmd/upspin-deploy-gcp
	$ upspin-deploy-gcp -release-image

Delete the secrets directory, to prevent leakages:
	$ rm -r secrets

Create a trigger that runs the relevant build steps
on each new commit to the 'upspin' and 'augie' repos:
	$ ./createtriggers.sh

To test that everything is working, trigger the builds manually:
	https://cloud.google.com/gcr/triggers
Once complete, fresh binaries should be visible in the release@upspin.io tree.
If the build fails, look at the log output of the build for clues:
